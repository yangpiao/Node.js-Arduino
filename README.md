Arduino Control Center
======================

Intro
-----

Node powered app that collects sensor data and sends commands to Arduino.
[Node.js, Arduino, Express, MongoDB, Backbone, D3]

- Use Firmata and Node.js to control Arduino.
- Visualize sensors' data on an Express website.

TODO
----

- Arduino control (uploading data & receiving commands)
- Better code for the real-time chart, now the code is like crap
